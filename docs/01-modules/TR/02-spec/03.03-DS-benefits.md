# Common Validation Patterns

## Date Validations

**Past Date Check**
```
date <= today (for historical events)
```

**Coverage Period Check**
```
serviceDate must be within enrollment's effectiveDate and endDate
```

**Enrollment Window**
```
Changes must be within enrollment period or life event window
```

## Decimal Precision

All decimal fields (amounts, percentages):
- Precision: 2 decimal places
- Rounding: HALF_UP
- Example: 1500.00, 15.50, 0.75

## Percentage Validations

Contribution percentages, benefit allocations:
- Range: 0-100
- Precision: 2 decimal places
- Sum constraints where applicable

## Dependent Age Calculations

```
age = today - dateOfBirth
```
- Age limits vary by country and benefit type
- US: Children typically covered until age 26
