## 📋 Overview

This guide explains how employment relationships are modeled in the xTalent Core Module using the **4-level employment hierarchy**. Understanding this structure is fundamental to working with the system.

### What You'll Learn
- The 4 levels of employment hierarchy
- Why we separate Worker, WorkRelationship, Employee, and Assignment
- How to handle different employment scenarios
- Best practices for managing employment data

### Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of HR concepts
- Familiarity with employment types (employees, contractors, etc.)

## 🎯 The Problem with Traditional HR Systems

### Traditional Approach (Single "Employee" Entity)

Most legacy HR systems use a single "Employee" entity that combines:
- Person identity (name, date of birth)
- Employment contract (hire date, employee number)
- Job assignment (position, department, manager)

**Problems with this approach**:

❌ **Cannot handle contractors** - They're not "employees" but still need to be in the system  
❌ **Rehires are messy** - Same person, new employee record → duplicate data  
❌ **Multiple jobs unclear** - How to handle someone with 2 concurrent positions?  
❌ **History tracking poor** - Hard to distinguish person changes vs employment changes  
❌ **Inflexible** - Doesn't match how real organizations work

**Example Problem**:
```
John Doe works as:
- Full-time Employee (Backend Engineer)
- Part-time Contractor (Technical Advisor)

Traditional system: Create 2 "Employee" records? 
→ Duplicate person data, confusing identity
```

## ✨ The xTalent Solution: 4-Level Hierarchy

### The 4 Levels Explained

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Level 1: WORKER (Person Identity)              │
│ "Who is this person?"                           │
│ • Name, DOB, National ID                        │
│ • Immutable identity                            │
│ • Created once, never deleted                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Level 3: EMPLOYEE (Contract Details)            │
│ "What are the employment contract terms?"       │
│ • Only for EMPLOYEE-type relationships          │
│ • Hire date, probation, employee number         │
│ • One per work relationship (1:1)               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                    ↓

## 📊 Level 1: Worker (Person Identity)

### Purpose
**Immutable person identity** - represents the actual human being, independent of their employment status.

### Key Characteristics

|--------|---------|
| **Created When** | First interaction with organization (apply, hire, onboard) |
| **Deleted When** | NEVER (soft delete only for GDPR) |
| **Changes When** | Legal name change, personal data updates |
| **Uniqueness** | One worker = one person (forever) |

### Key Attributes

```yaml
Worker:
  id: WORKER-12345
  full_name: "Nguyễn Văn An"
  preferred_name: "An"
  date_of_birth: 1990-05-15
  national_id: "001234567890"
  person_type: EMPLOYEE  # or CONTRACTOR, APPLICANT, ALUMNUS
  gender_code: M
  marital_status_code: MARRIED
  
  # Data classification
  data_classification: CONFIDENTIAL
  
  # Audit
  created_at: 2024-01-01T10:00:00Z
  updated_at: 2024-06-15T14:30:00Z
```

### Person Types

|------|-------------|---------------------|
| **EMPLOYEE** | Full-time/part-time employee | ✅ Yes |
| **CONTRACTOR** | Independent contractor | ❌ No |
| **CONSULTANT** | External consultant | ❌ No |
| **INTERN** | Intern/trainee | ⚠️ Optional |
| **APPLICANT** | Job applicant | ❌ No |
| **ALUMNUS** | Former employee | ❌ No (anymore) |
| **DEPENDENT** | Family member/dependent | ❌ No |

### Real-World Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: New Hire
```yaml
# Step 1: Create Worker (during application)
Worker:
  full_name: "Trần Thị Bình"
  person_type: APPLICANT
  
# Step 2: Update person_type when hired
Worker:
  full_name: "Trần Thị Bình"
  person_type: EMPLOYEE  # Changed from APPLICANT
```

#### Scenario 2: Contractor to Employee
```yaml
# Worker record stays the same!
Worker:
  id: WORKER-99999
  full_name: "Lê Văn Cường"
  # Person type will be updated based on active work relationships
```

#### Scenario 3: Rehire
```yaml
# Same worker record is reused

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Creating Multiple Workers for Same Person
❌ **Wrong**:
```yaml
# Contractor period
Worker: WORKER-001 (Contractor)

# Employee period
Worker: WORKER-002 (Employee)  # DUPLICATE!
```

✅ **Correct**:
```yaml
# Same worker, different relationships
Worker: WORKER-001
  WorkRelationship: WR-001 (CONTRACTOR)
  WorkRelationship: WR-002 (EMPLOYEE)
```

### Pitfall 2: Creating Employee Record for Contractors
❌ **Wrong**:
```yaml
WorkRelationship: WR-001
  type: CONTRACTOR

Employee: EMP-001  # WRONG! Contractors don't have Employee records
```

✅ **Correct**:
```yaml
WorkRelationship: WR-001
  type: CONTRACTOR
  
# NO Employee record
# Assignment links directly to WorkRelationship
```

### Pitfall 3: Not Ending Previous Assignment
❌ **Wrong**:
```yaml
# Old assignment still active
Assignment: ASG-001
  effective_end: null
  is_current: true

# New assignment also active
Assignment: ASG-002
  effective_end: null
  is_current: true  # CONFLICT!
```

✅ **Correct**:
```yaml
# End old assignment
Assignment: ASG-001
  effective_end: 2024-06-30
  is_current: false

# Start new assignment
Assignment: ASG-002
  effective_start: 2024-07-01
  effective_end: null
  is_current: true
```
