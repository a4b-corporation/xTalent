## 2. User Story

**As an** HR Administrator  
**I want to** view a comprehensive timeline of all employment-related events for an employee  
**So that** I can track their complete employment history, understand career progression, and make informed decisions about promotions, compensation, and development

## 3. Business Context

### Purpose
Working Records (Hồ Sơ Làm Việc) provides a complete, chronological view of an employee's journey within the organization. This event-driven system captures every significant employment change—from hiring to termination—creating an immutable audit trail that supports:

- **HR Decision Making**: Understand career progression for promotion and development decisions
- **Compliance & Auditing**: Complete audit trail for labor law compliance
- **Talent Analytics**: Track patterns in career paths, tenure, and turnover
- **Employee Self-Service**: Transparency in employment history

### Key Stakeholders
- **HR Administrators**: Track employment lifecycle, process changes
- **HR Managers**: Analyze career progression, make talent decisions
- **Employees**: View personal employment history
- **Auditors**: Verify compliance, investigate discrepancies

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: View working records for active employee

```gherkin
Given Employee EMP-2024-001 has 15 employment events
  | Event Type          | Date       |
  | HIRE                | 2024-01-01 |
  | PROBATION_END       | 2024-03-01 |
  | PROMOTION           | 2024-07-01 |
  | SALARY_INCREASE     | 2024-12-01 |
  | TRANSFER            | 2024-10-01 |
When HR Admin opens working records for EMP-2024-001
Then All 15 events are displayed chronologically with full details
  AND current employment state shows:
    | Field              | Value              |
    | Job                | Lead Engineer      |
    | Grade              | G4                 |
    | Business Unit      | Platform Team      |
    | Status             | ACTIVE             |
    | Years of Service   | 0.95               |
```

### Scenario 2: View working records for rehired employee

```gherkin
Given Worker WORKER-002 has two employment periods:
  | Employee Code | Period              | Status      | Events |
  | EMP-2020-050  | 2020-01-01 to 2022-12-31 | TERMINATED  | 25     |
  | EMP-2024-075  | 2024-01-01 to present    | ACTIVE      | 8      |
When HR Admin views working records for WORKER-002
Then Both Working Record lines are displayed
  AND total service time is calculated: 3.95 years
  AND gap period is shown: 1.0 years (2023-01-01 to 2023-12-31)
  AND career progression across both employments is visible
```

### Scenario 3: Filter events by category

```gherkin
Given Employee has 25 events across multiple categories:
  | Category        | Count |
  | JOB_ASSIGNMENT  | 8     |
  | COMPENSATION    | 6     |
  | LEAVE           | 4     |
  | CONTRACT        | 5     |
  | PERSONAL_DATA   | 2     |
When User filters by "Job Assignment" events only
Then Only 8 events are displayed (promotions, transfers, position changes)
  AND event count shows "8 of 25 events"
  AND filter tags are clearly visible
```

### Scenario 4: Export working records

```gherkin
Given Employee has complete working record history (30 events)
When User clicks "Export to PDF"
Then PDF document is generated containing:
  | Section                | Content                              |
  | Header                 | Employee name, code, photo           |
  | Summary                | Hire date, tenure, current status    |
  | Timeline               | All events chronologically           |
  | Current State          | Job, grade, salary, location         |
  | Footer                 | Generated timestamp, authorized by   |
```

### Scenario 5: View point-in-time state

```gherkin
Given Employee has 20 events from 2020-01-01 to 2024-12-31
When User selects "View state as of 2022-06-30"
Then Employment state as of that date is displayed:
  | Field         | Value (as of 2022-06-30)  |
  | Job           | Senior Engineer             |
  | Grade         | G2                          |
  | Salary        | 70,000,000 VND              |
  | Business Unit | Backend Team                |
  | Location      | HCM Office                  |
  AND user can navigate forward/backward through time
  AND current date indicator is clearly marked
```

## 8. Business Rules

### Data Access Rules
- **[[BR-EMP-001]]**: Only authorized users can view working records
- Employees can view their own working records
- HR staff can view all employee working records within their business unit
- Auditors have read-only access to all working records

### Event Display Rules
- Events must be displayed in chronological order (oldest to newest, or newest to oldest)
- Each event must show: date, type, summary, and key details
- Sensitive information (salary) requires additional permission

### Worker-Level Aggregation Rules
- When viewing working records for a Worker with multiple employments:
  - Each employment has a separate Working Record line
  - Total service time is calculated across all employments
  - Gap periods between employments are clearly indicated

## 9. Data Requirements

### Primary Entities
- **[[Employee]]**: Core employee record with current state
- **[[WorkRelationship]]**: Employment relationship data
- **[[Assignment]]**: Job assignments and transfers
- **[[Contract]]**: Employment contracts

### Event Data
- All employment events are stored in the Event Store
- Events are immutable (append-only)
- Event categories: EMPLOYMENT_LIFECYCLE, JOB_ASSIGNMENT, COMPENSATION, CONTRACT, LEAVE, ORGANIZATIONAL, PERSONAL_DATA

### Calculated Fields
- **Years of Service**: Calculated from hire date to current date (or termination date)
- **Total Events**: Count of all events for the employment
- **Current State**: Derived by replaying all events chronologically

## 10. Technical Notes

### Performance Considerations
- Event queries should be indexed by `employee_id` and `effective_date`
- Consider caching current state snapshots to avoid recalculating from events
- For workers with many events (100+), implement pagination

### Export Functionality
- PDF export should include: employee photo, summary, complete timeline, current state
- Export should be watermarked with generation timestamp and authorized by user

### Point-in-Time Queries
- Enable "time travel" queries: "What was this employee's state on 2022-06-30?"
- Implement by replaying events up to the specified date
- Cache historical snapshots for common query dates (month-end, year-end)

- **Data Completeness**: % of employees with complete event history
- **Query Performance**: Average page load time < 2 seconds
- **Export Usage**: Number of PDF exports per month
