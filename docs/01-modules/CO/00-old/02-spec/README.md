Concept (01-concept)
  ↓ Translate business requirements
Specification (02-spec)  ← ✅ COMPLETE
  ↓ Implement technical details
Design (03-design)
  ↓ Build the system
Implementation (04-implementation)
```

## 🎓 Best Practices

### Writing Specifications

✅ **DO**:
- Be specific and unambiguous
- Use consistent terminology
- Provide examples
- Reference related specs
- Include diagrams where helpful
- Version control all specs
- Review with stakeholders
- Update specs when requirements change

❌ **DON'T**:
- Use vague language ("should", "might", "probably")
- Assume knowledge
- Skip validation rules
- Ignore edge cases
- Write specs in isolation
- Forget to version
- Skip reviews

### Specification Format

```yaml
# Good Example
FR-EMP-001: Create Worker Record
  Description: System shall create a new worker record with validated data
  Priority: HIGH
  Acceptance Criteria:
    - Given valid worker data
    - When HR Admin submits create form
    - Then worker record is created
    - And worker ID is generated (format: WORKER-NNNNNN)
    - And audit log entry is created

# Bad Example
"The system should probably create workers when needed"
# Too vague, no criteria, no priority
```
