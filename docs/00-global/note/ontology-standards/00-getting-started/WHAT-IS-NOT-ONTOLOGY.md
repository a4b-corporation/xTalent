# What Is NOT Ontology

**Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-12-25  
**Audience**: All roles (BA, Developer, Architect)  
**Purpose**: Prevent 99% of classification errors when defining domain entities

## 🎯 Why This Document Matters

The #1 cause of architectural debates in enterprise systems:

> **"Is this an Entity or something else?"**

Without clear boundaries, teams consistently make these mistakes:
- Workflows get stuffed into ontology
- Snapshots get classified as entities
- ERD tables are assumed to be ontology
- Transaction logs are treated as domain objects

**This document provides clear decision rules** to prevent these errors.

## 🧠 The Core Question

Ontology answers ONE fundamental question:

> **"What things EXIST in the business domain?"**

If your artifact answers a different question, it's NOT ontology.

| Question Being Answered | This Is... | NOT Ontology |
|------------------------|------------|--------------|
| What **exists**? | ✅ Ontology | - |
| How do we **understand** it? | Concept Model | ✅ |
| How does it **happen over time**? | Workflow/Process | ✅ |
| What **already happened**? | Transaction/Fact | ✅ |
| What **was the state at a point in time**? | Snapshot | ✅ |

## 🚫 4 Things That Are NOT Ontology

### 1. Workflow / Process

**What it is**: A sequence of steps that happen over time

**Why it's NOT ontology**:
- Has runtime execution
- Involves time progression
- Creates or modifies instances

**Example (Core HR)**:
```
❌ NOT Ontology: "Hire Employee Process"
   - Step 1: Create Employee record
   - Step 2: Assign to Position
   - Step 3: Generate Contract
   - Step 4: Send onboarding email

✅ IS Ontology: "Employee", "Position", "Contract"
   - These are the things that EXIST
   - The workflow operates ON them
```

**Example (Total Rewards)**:
```
❌ NOT Ontology: "Process Payroll Run"
   - Step 1: Collect time data
   - Step 2: Calculate earnings
   - Step 3: Apply deductions
   - Step 4: Generate pay slips

✅ IS Ontology: "PayElement", "BenefitPlan", "Deduction"
   - These define WHAT exists
   - The payroll run USES them
```

---

### 2. Transaction / Fact / Event

**What it is**: A record of something that already happened

**Why it's NOT ontology**:
- Immutable (cannot be changed)
- Point-in-time occurrence
- Generated by processes

**Example (Core HR)**:
```
❌ NOT Ontology: "EmployeeStatusChange" transaction
   - employee_id: EMP001
   - from_status: ACTIVE
   - to_status: TERMINATED  
   - changed_at: 2025-01-15
   - changed_by: HR_ADMIN

✅ IS Ontology: "Employee" with status attribute
   - Has lifecycle states
   - The transaction RECORDS changes to it
```

**Example (Total Rewards)**:
```
❌ NOT Ontology: "PayResult" (a payroll transaction)
   - period: 2025-01
   - gross_pay: 5000
   - net_pay: 4200
   - processed_at: 2025-01-31

✅ IS Ontology: "PayElement" (what CAN be paid)
   - earning_type: SALARY
   - calculation_rule: MONTHLY
   - The PayResult is an INSTANCE of calculation
```

---

### 3. Snapshot / Historical State

**What it is**: A frozen view of data at a specific point in time

**Why it's NOT ontology**:
- Derived from current entities
- Time-specific copy
- For reporting/audit purposes

**Example (Core HR)**:
```
❌ NOT Ontology: "EmployeeSnapshot_2025Q1"
   - Frozen count of employees by department
   - Used for quarterly reporting

✅ IS Ontology: "Employee", "Department"
   - The snapshot is DERIVED from these
```

**Example (Total Rewards)**:
```
❌ NOT Ontology: "BenefitEnrollmentSnapshot"
   - Frozen state of all enrollments at year-end
   - For compliance audit

✅ IS Ontology: "BenefitPlan", "Enrollment"
   - The snapshot captures their STATE at a moment
```

---

### 4. Configuration / Settings

**What it is**: System parameters that control behavior

**Why it's NOT ontology** (usually):
- Technical, not business domain
- Affects HOW system works, not WHAT exists
- Can change without business meaning change

**Example (Core HR)**:
```
❌ NOT Ontology: "SystemConfiguration"
   - password_expiry_days: 90
   - max_login_attempts: 5

✅ IS Ontology: "SecurityPolicy" (if business-defined)
   - When security rules have business meaning
   - Defined by governance, not IT
```

**Example (Total Rewards)**:
```
❌ NOT Ontology: "PayrollScheduleConfig"
   - batch_size: 1000
   - retry_attempts: 3
   - timeout_seconds: 300

✅ IS Ontology: "PayPeriod", "PayCalendar"
   - These have business meaning
   - Defined by HR policy, not IT
```

## ✅ Quick Decision Checklist

Use this checklist when you're unsure:

```
□ 1. Does it represent a THING that exists in the business?
     → If NO: Not ontology

□ 2. Is it independent of time/execution?
     → If it only exists during a process: Not ontology

□ 3. Does it have business identity beyond a single transaction?
     → If it's a one-time record: Not ontology (it's a Transaction)

□ 4. Would business users recognize it as a "thing"?
     → If only IT knows about it: Probably not ontology

□ 5. Can instances of it be created, modified, deleted?
     → If immutable after creation: Probably a Transaction
```

**If you answered "NO" to questions 1 or 2, it's definitely NOT ontology.**

### Core HR Module

| ✅ IS Ontology | ❌ NOT Ontology | Why NOT? |
|---------------|-----------------|----------|
| Employee | HireEmployeeWorkflow | It's a process, not a thing |
| Position | PromotionTransaction | It's a fact/event record |
| Department | OrgChartSnapshot | It's a derived view |
| Contract | ContractSigningProcess | It's execution flow |
| Assignment | AssignmentHistory | It's transaction log |

### Total Rewards Module

| ✅ IS Ontology | ❌ NOT Ontology | Why NOT? |
|---------------|-----------------|----------|
| PayElement | PayrollRunWorkflow | It's execution process |
| BenefitPlan | EnrollmentTransaction | It's a recorded event |
| Deduction | DeductionCalculation | It's computation logic |
| Bonus | BonusPayoutResult | It's transaction output |
| EligibilityProfile | EligibilityCheck | It's runtime evaluation |

## 💡 Key Takeaway

> **Ontology = The vocabulary of your business domain**  
> **Everything else = Uses that vocabulary to describe actions, events, or views**

When in doubt, ask:
> "Is this a NOUN (thing) or a VERB (action) or an ADJECTIVE (description)?"

- **Nouns** → Ontology candidates
- **Verbs** → Workflow candidates  
- **Past-tense verbs** → Transaction candidates
- **Adjectives of nouns** → Attributes of ontology entities
